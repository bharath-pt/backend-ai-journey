## Overview

This repository documents my journey from a backend developer to an AI/ML practitioner.  
Over the course of weeks/months, I focused on **hands-on learning** of Python, data handling, and foundational machine learning concepts.  

The goal is to **build practical skills** rather than just consuming theory, preparing for cloud-based AI/ML workflows and real-world applications.
